> Open-source multi-agent orchestration system for AI coding agents.
> Orchestrate any AI coding agent. Any model. One command.

## Overview

Bernstein is a Python-based orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI coding agents working in parallel on a single codebase. It decomposes goals into tasks, assigns them to the most appropriate agents and models, isolates work in git worktrees, verifies results through quality gates, and merges verified output.

The orchestrator itself is deterministic Python code — no LLM tokens are spent on coordination, scheduling, or task management. LLMs are only used by the agents themselves to write code.

---

## Quick Start

### One-liner
\`\`\`bash
bernstein -g "add user authentication with JWT tokens"
\`\`\`

### With a plan file
\`\`\`bash
bernstein run plans/my-project.yaml
\`\`\`

### Basic workflow
1. Install Bernstein: \`pipx install bernstein\`
2. cd into your project directory
3. Run: \`bernstein -g "your goal here"\`
4. Bernstein decomposes the goal, spawns agents, and orchestrates the work
5. Review the results in your git history

---

## Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Deterministic orchestrator**: The orchestrator is pure Python code. No LLM calls for scheduling, routing, or coordination. This makes behavior predictable, debuggable, and fast.

2. **File-based state**: All state lives in the \`.sdd/\` directory — backlog, runtime data, metrics, configuration. No in-memory-only state that would be lost on crash.

3. **Short-lived agents**: Agents handle 1-3 tasks each, then exit. No long-running agent processes. Fresh context per task prevents hallucination drift.

4. **Agent-agnostic**: Works with any CLI coding agent. Currently ships 31 adapters. Adding a new agent requires implementing a simple adapter interface.

5. **Model-per-task routing**: A contextual bandit router learns which model works best for each task type and complexity level. In our own runs, the bandit router cut spend roughly in half compared to uniformly using expensive models. Measure yours with bernstein cost.

## Configuration

Bernstein has 150+ configurable parameters. Key ones:

### Environment Variables
- \`BERNSTEIN_MAX_AGENTS\`: Maximum concurrent agents (default: 5)
- \`BERNSTEIN_DEFAULT_MODEL\`: Default model for tasks
- \`BERNSTEIN_BUDGET_LIMIT\`: Maximum cost per run in USD
- \`BERNSTEIN_QUALITY_GATES\`: Comma-separated list of quality gates to run

### Configuration File (\`.sdd/config.yaml\`)
\`\`\`yaml
orchestration:
  max_agents: 5
  tick_interval: 10
  drain_timeout: 300

routing:
  strategy: contextual_bandit
  epsilon: 0.1
  default_model: sonnet

quality:
  gates:
    - lint
    - typecheck
    - test
    - security
  retry_on_failure: true
  max_retries: 2
  escalate_model_on_retry: true

  alert_threshold: 0.8
  track_per_agent: true

git:
  worktree_base: .worktrees
  auto_merge: true
  merge_strategy: squash
\`\`\`

---

## Quality Gates

Quality gates run automatically on every task result before merge.

### Built-in Gates
1. **Lint** (ruff): Code style and common errors
2. **Type check** (pyright/mypy): Static type verification
3. **Tests** (pytest): Run test suite, check for regressions
4. **Security** (bandit/semgrep): Security vulnerability scanning
5. **Architecture conformance**: Verify changes follow project structure rules

### Gate Behavior
- Tasks that fail quality gates are retried
- On retry, the model may be escalated (e.g., Sonnet -> Opus)
- After max retries, tasks go to the dead letter queue
- Cross-model verification optionally gets a second opinion from a different model

---

## Cost Tracking

Bernstein tracks costs at multiple levels:

- **Per-agent**: How much each spawned agent costs
- **Per-model**: Breakdown by model (Opus vs Sonnet vs Haiku)
- **Per-task**: Cost attributed to each task
- **Per-run**: Total cost for the entire orchestration run

### Budget Enforcement
- Set a hard budget limit per run
- Alert threshold warns when approaching budget
- Automatic drain mode when budget exhausted (finish current tasks, don't start new ones)

### Anomaly Detection
- Detects unusual cost spikes
- Alerts on agents consuming more tokens than expected
- Auto-intervention for runaway agents (context growth detection)

---

## Security Features

- **HMAC audit logs**: Tamper-evident logging of all orchestration actions
- **Policy engine**: Define policies for what agents can and cannot do
- **PII gating**: Prevent agents from accessing files containing PII
- **Credential scoping**: Each agent gets only the credentials it needs
- **Git worktree isolation**: Agents cannot interfere with each other's work

---

## Observability

### Prometheus Metrics
Bernstein exports metrics to Prometheus:
- \`bernstein_tasks_total\` (counter, labels: status, role)
- \`bernstein_agents_active\` (gauge)
- \`bernstein_cost_usd\` (counter, labels: model, agent)
- \`bernstein_quality_gate_results\` (counter, labels: gate, result)
- \`bernstein_tick_duration_seconds\` (histogram)

### OpenTelemetry
Full distributed tracing support via OpenTelemetry:
- Spans for each orchestration tick
- Spans for agent spawn, task assignment, quality gate execution
- Trace context propagation to agents

### Grafana Dashboards
Pre-built dashboard templates for:
- Orchestration overview
- Cost analysis
- Quality trends
- Agent utilization

---

## Protocol Support

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Bernstein can run as an MCP server, exposing orchestration capabilities as tools:
- \`bernstein_run\`: Start orchestration
- \`bernstein_status\`: Check status
- \`bernstein_tasks\`: List and manage tasks
- \`bernstein_cost\`: View cost breakdown
- \`bernstein_stop\`: Stop orchestration

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)
Support for Google's A2A protocol for inter-agent communication and task delegation.

---

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| manager | High-level planning and decomposition |
| vp | Strategic oversight |
| backend | Backend implementation |
| frontend | Frontend implementation |
| qa | Testing and quality assurance |
| security | Security review and hardening |
| devops | CI/CD and infrastructure |

---

## How It Compares

Two comparison axes. LLM-orchestration frameworks (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph) orchestrate LLM calls. CLI-agent orchestrators (ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator, emdash) are the closer category.

### vs LLM-orchestration frameworks

| Feature | Bernstein | CrewAI | AutoGen | LangGraph |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Orchestrator | Deterministic code | LLM-driven (+ code Flows) | LLM-driven | Graph + LLM |
| CLI agent support | 31 adapters | No | No | No |
| Agent isolation | Worktrees or pluggable cloud sandbox | No | No | No |
| Quality gates | Built-in | Guardrails + Pydantic output | Termination conditions | Conditional edges |
| Cost tracking | Per-agent | \`usage_metrics\` | \`RequestUsage\` | Via LangSmith |
| Self-evolution | Built-in (experimental) | No | No | No |
| File-based state | Yes (.sdd/) | In-memory + SQLite checkpoint | In-memory | Checkpointer |
| Model routing | Contextual bandit | Per-agent LLM | Per-agent \`model_client\` | Per-node (manual) |

### vs CLI-agent orchestrators

| Feature | Bernstein | ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator | emdash |
|---------|-----------|------------------------------|--------|
| Shape | Python CLI + library + MCP server | TypeScript CLI + dashboard | Electron desktop app |
| Primary language | Python | TypeScript | TypeScript |
| Install | \`pipx install bernstein\` | \`npm install -g @aoagents/ao\` | .dmg / .msi / .AppImage |
| Agent adapters | 18 | 3 (Claude Code, Codex, Aider) | 23 |
| MCP server mode (exposes self) | Yes (stdio + HTTP/SSE) | No | No |
| Coordinator | Deterministic Python scheduler | LLM-driven | Not documented |
| HMAC-chained audit replay | Yes | No | No |
| Autonomous CI-fix / PR flow | No | Yes | No |
| License | Apache 2.0 | MIT | Apache 2.0 |

Bernstein's wedge in the CLI-orchestrator category: Python-native primitive, MCP-server-first (exposes itself over MCP so any MCP client can invoke orchestration as tools), widest adapter coverage including Qwen / Ollama / Goose / OpenAI Agents SDK / Cloudflare Agents. Composio's \`@aoagents/ao\` is the right pick for TypeScript shops wanting autonomous CI-fix and a dashboard. emdash is the right pick for users wanting a downloadable desktop ADE.

## FAQ

### What is Bernstein?
Bernstein is an open-source multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates AI coding agents (like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) to work in parallel on your codebase. It decomposes goals into tasks, assigns them to agents, and verifies the results.

### How does Bernstein differ from CrewAI or AutoGen?
Bernstein's orchestrator is deterministic Python code — no LLM tokens are spent on coordination. It works with real CLI coding agents (not API-only models) and provides git worktree isolation, quality gates, and cost tracking out of the box.

### What agents does Bernstein support?
Bernstein ships 31 adapters for popular coding agents including Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Cursor, Aider, Amp, Ollama, GitHub Copilot, Droid, Crush, and more. It also has a generic adapter for wrapping any CLI tool.

### How does task routing work?
Bernstein uses a contextual bandit (epsilon-greedy) router that learns which model works best for each task type and complexity. Simple tasks go to cheaper models (Haiku, Flash), complex architecture tasks go to expensive models (Opus). In our own runs, the bandit router cut spend roughly in half compared to using expensive models for everything. Measure yours with bernstein cost.

### Is Bernstein free?
Yes. Bernstein is open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. You pay only for the AI model API usage of the agents themselves.

### Can I use Bernstein with local models?
Yes. Use the Ollama adapter to run fully local models. You can also mix local and cloud models in the same run.

### How does quality gating work?
After each agent completes a task, Bernstein runs configurable quality gates: linting (ruff), type checking (pyright), test execution (pytest), and security scanning (bandit/semgrep). Failed tasks are retried, potentially with a more capable model. After max retries, tasks go to a dead letter queue for manual review.

### What happens if an agent crashes?
Bernstein monitors agents via heartbeat. If an agent stops responding, it is reaped and the task is reassigned. Work-in-progress in the agent's worktree is preserved for potential recovery.

### Can I define multi-step projects?
Yes. YAML plan files let you define stages with dependencies, and steps with roles, priorities, and complexity levels. Stages execute in dependency order; steps within a stage can execute in parallel.

### Does Bernstein support MCP?
Yes. Bernstein can run as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, exposing its orchestration capabilities as tools that other MCP-compatible systems can invoke.

### Does Bernstein work with the OpenAI Agents SDK?
Yes. The \`openai_agents\` adapter embeds OpenAI's Agents SDK v2 as a first-class runtime. Each task runs in an Agents SDK session against the Responses API, so you get OpenAI's tool-calling, handoffs, and guardrails inside Bernstein's orchestrator without shelling out to a CLI. Install with \`pip install "bernstein[openai-agents]"\`.

### What sandbox backends does Bernstein support?
Bernstein exposes a \`SandboxBackend\` protocol. The default backend is a git worktree on the local machine. You can swap in Docker, E2B, Modal, Blaxel, Cloudflare Workers sandboxes, Daytona, Runloop, or Vercel sandboxes by setting \`sandbox.backend\` in \`bernstein.yaml\` and installing the matching extra (for example \`pip install "bernstein[e2b]"\`). The orchestrator and adapters do not change.

### Can I store \`.sdd/\` state and artifacts in the cloud?
Yes. The \`BufferedSink\` wrapper batches writes and forwards them to pluggable storage backends: local disk, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or Cloudflare R2. Configure under the \`storage\` block in \`bernstein.yaml\` and install the relevant extra (\`pip install "bernstein[s3]"\`, \`[gcs]\`, \`[azure]\`, or \`[r2]\`). Agents continue to read and write through the normal local-file API — only the persistence layer changes.

### What are progressive skill packs?
Bernstein ships its role guidance (backend, frontend, QA, security, DevOps, architect, reviewer, and so on) as progressive-disclosure skill packs instead of one giant system prompt. Agents start with a short bootstrap prompt and fetch individual skills on demand through the \`load_skill\` MCP tool. Only the skills a task actually touches are paid for in tokens, and packs can be versioned, added, or swapped without shipping a release. Skills live under \`templates/skills/\`.
